## 👋 Hello!
I'm a senior engineer at [Slack](https://www.slack.com/). I enjoy building fun things in Go and Python and tinkering with hardware.
- 📄 I'm working on [Quip](https://www.quip.com/), a standalone collaborative document platform that's also integrated into Slack
- 📹 I helped build Huddles, an audio/video communication tool used by millions
- 🔭 For fun I'm currently building a chainable HTTP sequence framework in Go
- 💬 Ask me about the joys of latency in realtime communication
